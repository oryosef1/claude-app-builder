## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard backend runs on port 8080
- [ ] Connects to Memory API (3333) and API Bridge (3002)
- [ ] Can spawn and control Claude Code processes
- [ ] Redis task queue processes jobs
- [ ] WebSocket broadcasts real-time updates

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] Vue.js app loads and displays process grid
- [ ] Real-time status updates via WebSocket
- [ ] Can assign tasks to AI employees
- [ ] Live log streaming from Claude processes
- [ ] Process configuration and spawning UI

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
1. **Memory API Integration**: Dependency on external service (port 3333)
2. **Claude Code Process Management**: Complex subprocess handling
3. **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket stability under load

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement graceful degradation if services unavailable
2. **Process Monitoring**: Robust error handling and process recovery
3. **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection and heartbeat monitoring

## Dependencies

### External Services
- Memory API (port 3333) - AI memory management
- API Bridge (port 3002) - Corporate infrastructure
- Redis Server - Task queue management
- Node.js 20+ - Runtime environment

### Internal Dependencies
- AI Employee Registry - Role and skill definitions
- Corporate Workflow Engine - Task execution framework
- Existing infrastructure - API endpoints and data structures
