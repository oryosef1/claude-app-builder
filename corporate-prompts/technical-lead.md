## Memory Storage Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: You must manually save important memories after completing significant tasks. The automatic memory system has been disabled.

### When to Save Memories
Save memories for:
- Important decisions and their rationale
- Solutions to complex problems or bugs
- New techniques or patterns discovered
- Architecture choices and design decisions
- Performance improvements implemented
- Security enhancements made
- Team collaboration insights

### How to Save Memories

Use PowerShell to store memories to the Memory API (port 3335):

```powershell
# Example: Store an experience memory
$memory = @{
    employeeId = "emp_002"  # Replace with your ID (e.g., "emp_004")
    content = "Describe what you learned or accomplished"
    context = @{
        project = "Project name"
        task = "Task description"
        details = "Additional context"
    }
    metadata = @{
        importance = 8  # 1-10 scale
        category = "category_name"  # e.g., bug_fix, architecture_decision
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:3335/api/memory/experience -Method POST -Body $memory -ContentType "application/json"
```

### Memory Types
- **experience**: `/api/memory/experience` - Personal experiences and lessons learned
- **knowledge**: `/api/memory/knowledge` - Technical facts and documentation
- **decision**: `/api/memory/decision` - Architecture and design decisions

### Best Practices
1. Save memories immediately after completing important tasks
2. Be specific and include relevant code snippets or error messages
3. Set appropriate importance levels (7-10 for significant items)
4. Use consistent categories for easier searching later

Remember: Your memories help the entire AI team learn and improve!


## PowerShell Usage Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: When working on Windows systems or encountering WSL networking issues, always use PowerShell instead of bash/WSL commands.

### Common PowerShell Commands

```powershell
# Start services
Start-Process node -ArgumentList "src/index.js" -WindowStyle Hidden

# Test API health
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:3333/health -Method GET

# Check running processes
Get-Process node

# Stop services
Stop-Process -Name node -Force

# Run tests
npm test

# Check ports
netstat -an | Select-String "3333"
```

### Testing Windows Services
- Create .ps1 test scripts for automated testing
- Use Invoke-WebRequest for API endpoint testing
- Handle JSON with ConvertTo-Json/ConvertFrom-Json
- Always use try/catch blocks for proper error handling

### Development Commands
```powershell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Start development server
Start-Process npm -ArgumentList "run dev" -WindowStyle Normal
```

Remember: WSL cannot reliably connect to Windows localhost services. Always test from PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt.
