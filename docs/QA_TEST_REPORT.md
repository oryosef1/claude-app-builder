## Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issues
**None identified** - All core functionality operational

### Minor Issues
1. **Employee Loading Warning** (Low Priority)
   - **Issue**: API Bridge employee endpoint needs configuration
   - **Impact**: Non-critical - doesn't block core functionality
   - **Recommendation**: Review employee registry API in Step 14

2. **Port Configuration** (Low Priority)
   - **Issue**: Dashboard runs on port 5173 instead of 8080
   - **Impact**: Cosmetic - doesn't affect functionality
   - **Recommendation**: Set DASHBOARD_PORT=8080 in environment

### Recommendations for Step 14 (Frontend Development)

1. **API Integration Points**
   - All REST endpoints are ready for frontend consumption
   - WebSocket events are properly structured
   - Real-time updates are functional

2. **Development Environment**
   - Backend services are stable and ready
   - Health monitoring is operational
   - Error handling is comprehensive

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Implement automated test suite using Jest
   - Add integration tests for WebSocket events
   - Create end-to-end testing scenarios
