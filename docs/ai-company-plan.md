# AI Software Company Implementation Plan

## üéØ Vision
Transform the current workflow into a full AI Software Company with 13 specialized AI employees, each with persistent memory, specialized tools, and corporate-grade infrastructure.

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Steps 1-3)
**Goal**: Basic corporate structure with improved system prompts
- **Step 1**: Design corporate role system prompts 
- **Step 2**: Create employee management infrastructure
- **Step 3**: Test single AI employee with new role system

### Phase 2: Memory Revolution (Steps 4-6)  
**Goal**: Vector database and persistent AI memory
- **Step 4**: Set up Pinecone vector database
- **Step 5**: Create AI memory management system
- **Step 6**: Test memory persistence across sessions

### Phase 3: Corporate Tools (Steps 7-9)
**Goal**: Specialized tools for each AI employee role
- **Step 7**: Build logging and monitoring infrastructure
- **Step 8**: Create role-specific dashboards and tools
- **Step 9**: Test full workflow with corporate structure

### Phase 4: Knowledge Management (Steps 10-12)
**Goal**: RAG system and corporate knowledge base
- **Step 10**: Implement RAG for intelligent responses
- **Step 11**: Create searchable knowledge base
- **Step 12**: Test knowledge sharing between AI employees

## üîß Technical Requirements

### What You Need to Provide:
1. **Pinecone API Key** - For vector database (free tier available)
2. **Docker/Docker Compose** - For infrastructure services
3. **Node.js 18+** - For any additional services we build

### What We'll Build Together:
1. **System Prompt Templates** - Corporate role definitions
2. **Memory Management API** - Vector storage and retrieval
3. **Employee Dashboard** - Performance and activity monitoring
4. **Knowledge Base** - Searchable corporate knowledge

## üìã Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Corporate System Prompts ‚úÖ NEXT
**Outcome**: Each AI role has a specialized, corporate-grade system prompt
**Test**: Single AI employee responds with corporate behavior
**Time**: 30-45 minutes

### Step 2: Employee Infrastructure
**Outcome**: Basic employee management (hiring, roles, performance)
**Test**: Can assign tasks to specific AI employees
**Time**: 45-60 minutes

### Step 3: Role Testing
**Outcome**: One complete workflow with new corporate structure
**Test**: Task completion with corporate roles working together
**Time**: 30 minutes

### Step 4: Vector Database Setup
**Outcome**: Pinecone connected and storing AI memories
**Test**: AI can store and retrieve memories from previous sessions
**Time**: 60 minutes

### Step 5: Memory Management
**Outcome**: Each AI has persistent memory and context
**Test**: AI remembers previous work and builds on it
**Time**: 45 minutes

### Step 6: Memory Testing
**Outcome**: Cross-session memory persistence working
**Test**: Stop/restart AI and it remembers everything
**Time**: 30 minutes
