# Future Workflow Improvements

## Issues to Fix in Next Conversation

### 1. Task Processing Strategy
**Problem**: System doing all tasks at the same time instead of 1 by 1
**Current**: Groups related tasks and processes them together
**Needed**: Option to force sequential processing for better control
**Solution**: Add flag to control batch vs sequential processing

### 2. Real-time Feedback
**Problem**: Workflow runs silently without progress updates
**Current**: Only shows phase completion messages
**Needed**: Live progress indicators during long operations
**Improvements**:
- Progress bars for test writing/implementation
- Real-time status of what's being worked on
- Estimated time remaining
- Live file counts (X tests written, Y components created)

### 3. Documentation Updates
**Problem**: System is clearing/overwriting important documentation files
**Current Issues**:
- todo.md gets completely cleared when tasks are done
- memory.md gets overwritten instead of appended to
- Loss of project history and context
**Needed**: Proper documentation preservation
**Requirements**:
- **NEVER clear todo.md** - Only mark items as [x] complete, preserve all history
- **APPEND to memory.md** - Add new sections, never delete existing content
- Preserve all project context and decisions
- Keep complete audit trail of all work done
- User controls when to clear/reset documentation files

### 4. Test Execution Verification
**Problem**: Need to verify tests are actually running during workflow
**Current**: Tests may be written but not executed properly
**Needed**: Automated test execution verification
**Improvements**:
- Force test execution in Test Reviewer phase
- Verify all tests pass before moving to Developer
- Display test results and coverage
- Fail workflow if tests don't run or pass

### 5. Workflow System Improvements
**Problem**: Current system prompts and workflow could be optimized
**Areas for Enhancement**:
- **System Prompts**: More specific instructions for each role
- **Error Recovery**: Better handling of failed phases
- **Quality Gates**: Stricter validation between phases
- **Output Formatting**: Cleaner, more structured outputs
- **Role Communication**: Better context passing between roles

### 6. Additional Improvements
- Add verbose mode for detailed logging
- Better error messages during workflow execution
- Ability to pause/resume workflow mid-process
- Save/restore workflow state
- Better handling of interruptions
- Improve system prompts for each role
- Add stricter quality gates between phases
- Better context preservation across roles

## Priority: High
These improvements will make the workflow more user-friendly and reliable.
