# Claude App Builder Memory

## System Purpose
An automated application builder that uses Claude Code CLI to create any type of software through Test-Driven Development (TDD). The system runs Claude in different roles to ensure high-quality code output.

## Core Principles
- **TDD First**: Always write tests before implementation
- **Modular Roles**: Each Claude instance has a specific responsibility
- **Automated Workflow**: Minimal human intervention required
- **Quality Gates**: Multiple review stages ensure code quality

## Technical Architecture
- **Orchestration**: Bash script runs Claude CLI with different prompts
- **Communication**: Roles communicate through files (memory.md, todo.md, feedback files)
- **Feedback Loops**: Automatic re-runs when reviews fail
- **Safety**: Maximum iteration limit prevents infinite loops

## Workflow Process
1. User defines app requirements in todo.md
2. System runs through 5 roles automatically:
   - Test Writer → Test Reviewer → Developer → Code Reviewer → Coordinator
3. Each role updates documentation
4. Process repeats until all todos complete
