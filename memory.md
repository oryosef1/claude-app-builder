# Memory - API Analysis

## API Test Issues Analysis

### Critical Issues Found:

1. **FileService Tests Failures**:
   - Tests expect mocked file system operations but FileService is using real fs operations
   - Tests expect specific todo format but actual todo.md has different structure
   - Memory.md content mismatch (expected vs actual)
   - Missing proper mocking of fs.writeFile calls

2. **WorkflowService Constructor Issues**:
   - E2E tests pass WebSocketService where ProcessManager is expected
   - WorkflowService constructor expects ProcessManager as first parameter
   - Type mismatch causing compilation errors

3. **WebSocketService Timestamp Issues**:
   - Tests expect timestamp to be mocked object `{inverse: false}` 
   - Actual implementation uses real Date timestamps
   - Broadcast method tests failing due to timestamp format mismatch

4. **E2E Test WebSocket Issues**:
   - WebSocket client possibly undefined in test setup
   - Connection handling not properly awaited
   - Multiple connection attempts without proper cleanup

### Root Cause:
- Tests were written for an interface that doesn't match actual implementation
- File system operations need proper mocking
- Constructor signatures don't match test expectations
- WebSocket service interface misalignment

## Fix Strategy:
1. Fix FileService tests with proper mocking
2. Correct WorkflowService constructor usage
3. Fix WebSocketService timestamp expectations
4. Fix E2E WebSocket client handling
5. Ensure real file operations work correctly
