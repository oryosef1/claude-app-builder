# Claude App Builder - System Memory

## System Overview
Claude App Builder is an automated TDD workflow system that uses Claude Code CLI to build applications. It orchestrates 5 different Claude roles to create high-quality software through test-driven development.

## Core Architecture

### 5 Claude Roles
1. **Test Writer** - Creates comprehensive test suites
2. **Test Reviewer** - Reviews and validates test quality  
3. **Developer** - Implements code to pass tests
4. **Code Reviewer** - Reviews code quality and runs tests
5. **Coordinator** - Manages workflow and documentation

### Key Files
- `automated-workflow.sh` - Main orchestration script
- `CLAUDE.md` - Role instructions and system behavior
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed system design
- `todo.md` - Task definitions and progress
- `memory.md` - This file - system knowledge
- `workflow.md` - Detailed workflow processes

### Communication System
- File-based communication between roles
- Feedback loops using temporary files (test-feedback.md, code-feedback.md)
- Quality gates between phases
- Auto-commit and checkpoint system

## Design Principles

### Test-Driven Development
- Tests written first, then implementation
- All tests must pass before proceeding
- Comprehensive coverage (unit, integration, e2e)

### Project Structure
- System files stay in root directory
- Generated projects go in separate directories (dashboard/, api/, etc.)
- Clean separation between system and project code

### Quality Assurance
- Multiple review stages
- Feedback loops for improvement
- Retry logic and error handling
- Safety limits to prevent infinite loops

## Current Status
-  Core system is clean and ready
-  All generated project files removed
-  System files preserved and organized
- <� Ready for new development projects

## Usage
1. Add requirements to todo.md
2. Run `./automated-workflow.sh`
3. Monitor progress in this file
4. Review generated code in project directories

## GitHub Integration

### Connection Setup
- ✅ **Remote configured** - Connected to `oryosef1/claude-app-builder` 
- ✅ **Authentication working** - Personal access token with `workflow` scope
- ✅ **Push functionality tested** - Successfully pushed cleanup commit `5347e9c`
- ✅ **Automated workflow integration** - Script uses PowerShell for git operations

### How It Works
- **WSL2 Workaround** - Uses `powershell.exe` for git commands due to library issues
- **Environment Configuration** - Loads GitHub settings from `.env` file
- **Auto-commits** - Workflow automatically commits after each successful phase
- **Auto-push** - Automatically pushes to GitHub after each phase when `GIT_AUTO_PUSH=true`
- **Release Management** - Creates tagged releases and pushes them to GitHub
- **Token management** - Uses GitHub personal access token for authentication

### Workflow Features
- ✅ **Automatic GitHub push after each successful phase**
- ✅ **Environment-driven configuration via .env file**
- ✅ **PowerShell git execution for WSL2 compatibility**
- ✅ **Release tagging and pushing**
- ✅ **Configurable auto-push (can be disabled)**

## Critical Test Execution Fixes

### Problem Solved
- **Issue**: Test Reviewer and Code Reviewer were approving without actually running tests
- **Impact**: Broken TDD workflow, tests never validated
- **Solution**: Mandatory test execution with zero tolerance policy

### Enhanced Reviewer Roles
- ✅ **Test Reviewer MUST run `npm test` using Bash tool**
- ✅ **Code Reviewer MUST run `npm test` using Bash tool**
- ✅ **Step-by-step prompts force test execution**
- ✅ **Zero tolerance - no approval without running tests**
- ✅ **Exact error messages required in feedback**

### Safety Mechanisms
- ✅ **Validation functions verify tests actually work**
- ✅ **Workflow blocks progression if tests fail**
- ✅ **Double-check test execution between phases**
- ✅ **Clear error messages when reviewers fail**

### Test Execution Requirements
- **Test Reviewer**: Must run `npm test` and verify tests fail correctly (without implementation)
- **Code Reviewer**: Must run `npm test` and verify ALL tests pass (100% success rate)
- **Validation**: Workflow automatically re-runs tests to confirm reviewer did their job
- **Feedback**: Exact error messages required, no generic responses allowed

## Test System Verification ✅

### Test Demonstration Complete
- **Unit Tests**: 17 tests covering Calculator class functionality
- **Integration Tests**: 15 tests covering CalculatorService multi-instance management
- **E2E Tests**: 8 tests covering complete workflow scenarios

## Test Writing/Review Workflow Failure ❌

### Failure Documentation
**Date**: 2025-07-06
**Coordinator**: Workflow Coordinator Claude
**Status**: TEST DEVELOPMENT PHASE FAILED - Multiple attempts unsuccessful

### What Failed
After multiple attempts, the test writing and review phases failed to successfully complete for the Express.js API server task. Despite extensive efforts to:
- Write comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, e2e)
- Fix test execution issues (dependencies, mocking, framework conflicts)
- Resolve test failures and environment problems
- Achieve high test pass rates (up to 100% in some attempts)

### Technical Issues Encountered
1. **Test Framework Conflicts**: Multiple migrations between Jest and Vitest
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Missing packages, version conflicts, environment setup
3. **Mock Implementation**: Complex mocking requirements for file system and process operations
4. **Environment Compatibility**: WSL/Windows path resolution and permission issues
5. **WebSocket Testing**: Real-time communication testing proved particularly challenging

### Lessons Learned
- Complex backend API testing with file system operations requires sophisticated test environment setup
- WebSocket real-time communication testing is inherently difficult in automated test suites
- Multiple test framework migrations created technical debt and instability
- Mock implementation for cross-platform file operations is non-trivial

### Current Status
- **API Implementation**: Exists but lacks validated test coverage
- **Dashboard Implementation**: Exists but test reliability unclear
- **WebSocket Communication**: Tests written but execution reliability questionable

### Manual Intervention Required
This task now requires manual developer intervention to:
1. Review existing implementation code quality
2. Set up proper test environment with correct dependencies
3. Implement focused, reliable test suite with simpler approach
4. Validate core functionality manually before proceeding

### Impact on Project
- **Development Progress**: Delayed but implementation exists
- **Quality Assurance**: Reduced confidence in automated testing
- **Future Tasks**: May need different approach for complex backend testing

The automated TDD workflow encountered limits with complex backend testing scenarios involving file systems, process management, and real-time communication.
