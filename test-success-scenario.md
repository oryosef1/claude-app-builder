# Test Success Path Scenario

This file documents testing the workflow success path with good code.

## Test Task (Good Code)

- [ ] Create calculateGoodSum function - Simple function that takes two numbers and returns their sum

This task is designed to pass all review phases on the first attempt.

### Expected Behavior:
1. TEST WRITER writes proper tests for calculateGoodSum function
2. TEST REVIEWER should APPROVE tests on first attempt (review_attempt=1)
3. DEVELOPER implements simple, clean calculateGoodSum function  
4. CODE REVIEWER should APPROVE implementation on first attempt (code_review_attempt=1)
5. Workflow proceeds directly to Coordinator phase
6. Coordinator marks task as [x] complete
7. No feedback files remain

### Success Criteria for Success Path Test:
- Test review passes on first attempt (no test-feedback.md created)
- Code review passes on first attempt (no code-feedback.md created)  
- Workflow proceeds through all phases without retries
- Task gets marked as [x] complete in todo.md
- Coordinator phase executes successfully
- No error messages or failed attempts

### Implementation Details:
```javascript
// Expected implementation (simple and clean):
function calculateGoodSum(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

// Expected tests (comprehensive but straightforward):
describe('calculateGoodSum', () => {
  it('should add two positive numbers', () => {
    expect(calculateGoodSum(2, 3)).toBe(5);
  });
  
  it('should handle negative numbers', () => {
    expect(calculateGoodSum(-2, 3)).toBe(1);
  });
  
  it('should handle zero', () => {
    expect(calculateGoodSum(0, 5)).toBe(5);
  });
});
```

This verifies that the workflow success path works normally and doesn't break good code flow.

### Comparison with Rejection Test:
- **Rejection Test**: calculateBrokenSum → Multiple rejection cycles → Workflow stops
- **Success Test**: calculateGoodSum → Single approval cycle → Workflow completes

Both tests together verify the complete fix of the rejection handling system.
