### 📊 Coverage by Component

| Component | Unit | Integration | E2E | Overall |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----|---------|
| Memory API | 40% | 60% | 80% | ~60% |
| Dashboard Backend | 50% | 70% | 90% | ~70% |
| API Bridge | 30% | 50% | 80% | ~53% |
| Dashboard Frontend | 20% | 10% | 0% | ~10% |
| **System Total** | **35%** | **48%** | **63%** | **~48%** |

### ❌ Not Tested

1. **Error Handling**
   - Network failures
   - Database connection errors
   - Invalid input scenarios
   - Race conditions

2. **Security**
   - Authentication flows
   - Authorization checks
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection prevention

3. **Performance**
   - Load testing
   - Stress testing
   - Memory leaks
   - Response time under load

4. **WebSocket/Real-time**
   - Socket.io events
   - Connection handling
   - Reconnection logic
   - Broadcasting

5. **Frontend User Flows**
   - Form submissions
   - Navigation
   - State management
   - Error states

### 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix TypeScript errors** in backend tests
2. **Add frontend interaction tests** with React Testing Library
3. **Implement WebSocket tests** for real-time features
4. **Add error scenario tests** for robustness
5. **Set up automated coverage reporting** with Jest/Vitest

### 📈 Target Coverage Goals

- Unit Tests: 80%
- Integration Tests: 70%
- E2E Tests: Key user flows
- Overall: 75-80%

## Conclusion

While we have good E2E test coverage (100% passing), the overall system test coverage is approximately **48%**. This is typical for a project at this stage, but additional testing is needed for production readiness.
