# Claude App Builder Dashboard - Todo List

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PRIORITY - URGENT FIXES (Do these FIRST, ONE BY ONE)

### Task 1: Fix API Test Method Calls
- [ ] **Read WorkflowService implementation** - Check what methods actually exist (src/services/workflow-service.ts)
- [ ] **Read WebSocketService implementation** - Check actual close() method signature (src/services/websocket-service.ts)  
- [ ] **Read ProcessManager implementation** - Check available cleanup methods (src/services/process-manager.ts)
- [ ] **Document actual service APIs** - List real methods in memory.md
- [ ] **Fix workflow-controller.test.ts** - Replace wrong method calls with correct ones
- [ ] **Fix api-integration.test.ts** - Replace wrong WebSocket calls with correct ones
- [ ] **Fix workflow-e2e.test.ts** - Replace wrong service calls with correct ones
- [ ] **Test one fixed file** - Run single test to verify fixes work

### Task 2: Fix Workflow Script Rejection Loops  
- [ ] **Create backup of automated-workflow.sh** - Copy to automated-workflow.sh.backup
- [ ] **Fix Test Reviewer logic (lines 695-712)** - Add proper while loop for multiple rejections
- [ ] **Fix Code Reviewer logic (lines 732-749)** - Add proper while loop for multiple rejections
- [ ] **Add quality validation function** - Create validate_phase_completion() function
- [ ] **Fix Coordinator logic (lines 752-754)** - Only run if all phases succeeded
- [ ] **Add max retry limits** - Set max_review_attempts=3 for each phase
- [ ] **Test with intentionally broken code** - Verify rejection loops work
- [ ] **Test with good code** - Verify success path still works

### WORKFLOW REJECTION TEST TASK (For Testing Only)
- [ ] **Create calculateBrokenSum function** - Function that takes two numbers but MUST throw error (intentionally broken to test rejection loops)

### WORKFLOW SUCCESS PATH TEST TASK (For Testing Only)  
- [ ] **Create calculateGoodSum function** - Simple function that takes two numbers and returns their sum (should pass all reviews on first attempt)

### Task 3: Add Workflow Safety Mechanisms
- [ ] **Add test execution validation** - Check npm test passes before proceeding
- [ ] **Add build validation** - Check npm run build succeeds before proceeding  
- [ ] **Add feedback file cleanup verification** - Ensure feedback files removed after fixes
- [ ] **Add rollback on persistent failures** - Reset to previous state after max retries
- [ ] **Add early exit conditions** - Stop workflow on unresolvable issues
- [ ] **Test safety mechanisms** - Create scenarios that trigger each safety check

## MEDIUM PRIORITY (Do after Critical tasks)

### Task 4: Verify All Systems Work
- [ ] **Run complete API test suite** - Ensure all tests pass with fixed method calls
- [ ] **Run complete dashboard test suite** - Ensure frontend tests work
- [ ] **Run full workflow end-to-end** - Test complete automation with real tasks
- [ ] **Document working patterns** - Update memory.md with successful fixes

## ðŸ“‹ INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING TASKS

### How to Work on These Tasks:
1. **Work on ONE task at a time** - Don't skip ahead
2. **Mark each sub-task [x] when done** - Update this file as you go
3. **Read the task description carefully** - Each task has specific files to check
4. **Update memory.md** - Document what you find and what you fix
5. **Test your changes** - Make sure each fix actually works before moving on

### Priority Order:
- **Task 1 FIRST** - Fix test method calls (these are breaking all tests)
- **Task 2 SECOND** - Fix workflow script loops (this fixes the rejection issue) 
- **Task 3 THIRD** - Add safety mechanisms (this prevents future issues)
- **Task 4 LAST** - Full system verification (this confirms everything works)

### When You Complete a Task:
- Mark ALL sub-tasks as [x] complete
- Add a summary to memory.md of what was fixed
- Test the fix to make sure it works
- Move to the next task

Start with **Task 1: Fix API Test Method Calls** - Read the first file and document what methods actually exist.
