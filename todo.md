- [ ] **Build file change notifications** - Notify dashboard of file updates

### Frontend Dashboard
- [ ] **Create React application** - Vite + TypeScript + Material-UI

- [ ] **Implement live output viewer** - Terminal-like interface for Claude output
- [ ] **Create task management interface** - Add/edit/complete tasks in todo.md
- [ ] **Build system metrics display** - CPU, memory, process health monitoring

### Dashboard Features
- [ ] **Workflow control panel** - Start/stop/pause buttons with confirmation
- [ ] **Progress visualization** - Progress bars and phase indicators
- [ ] **Task kanban board** - Visual task management with drag-and-drop
- [ ] **Configuration editor** - Update system settings through UI
- [ ] **Error handling UI** - Display errors and retry options

### WebSocket Client
- [ ] **Implement WebSocket client** - Connect to backend WebSocket server
- [ ] **Handle connection management** - Reconnection logic and error handling
- [ ] **Create real-time event handling** - Process incoming status updates
- [ ] **Build message queuing** - Handle offline/online synchronization

## üîß PHASE 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)

### Enhanced Process Control
- [ ] **Granular phase control** - Skip to specific phases, restart individual roles
- [ ] **Batch operation management** - Control multiple workflow runs
- [ ] **Advanced retry configuration** - Configurable retry limits and strategies
- [ ] **Workflow scheduling** - Queue and schedule workflow runs

### Analytics and Reporting
- [ ] **Workflow performance analytics** - Success rates, timing analysis
- [ ] **Error pattern analysis** - Common failure points and trends
- [ ] **Resource usage tracking** - CPU, memory, disk usage over time
- [ ] **Generate reports** - Export workflow statistics and metrics

### Integration Features
- [ ] **GitHub integration monitoring** - Track commits, pushes, PR creation
- [ ] **Build status tracking** - Monitor test results and build outcomes
- [ ] **Notification system** - Email/webhook notifications for workflow events
- [ ] **Export/import capabilities** - Backup and restore workflow configurations

### Security and Authentication
- [ ] **JWT authentication** - Secure API access with token-based auth
- [ ] **Role-based access control** - Different permissions for different users
- [ ] **Input validation and sanitization** - Secure all user inputs
- [ ] **Rate limiting** - Prevent abuse of API endpoints

## üöÄ PHASE 4: Production Ready (Week 7-8)

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Database optimization** - Indexing, query optimization
- [ ] **Caching layer** - Redis for frequently accessed data
- [ ] **API response optimization** - Pagination, compression, caching headers
- [ ] **Frontend performance** - Code splitting, lazy loading, memoization

### Deployment and DevOps
- [ ] **Docker containerization** - Backend and frontend containers
- [ ] **Docker Compose setup** - Multi-container orchestration
- [ ] **Environment configuration** - Production, staging, development configs
- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline** - Automated testing and deployment

### Documentation and Testing
- [ ] **API documentation** - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] **User guide** - Dashboard usage instructions
- [ ] **Test suite** - Unit, integration, and E2E tests
- [ ] **Performance testing** - Load testing and benchmarking

### Monitoring and Observability
- [ ] **Health check endpoints** - Application health monitoring

## üöÄ READY TO START

This dashboard will transform the Claude automated workflow from a command-line tool into a professional development automation platform. The phased approach ensures we build a solid foundation before adding advanced features.

**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 by creating the Node.js backend service and implementing the core process management system.
